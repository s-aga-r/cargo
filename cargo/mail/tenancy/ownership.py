"""Proof that a site controls a domain, required before the domain is added to it.

Clusters are shared between sites, so a domain claimed by the wrong site would lock its real
owner out. Nothing is stored for an unverified claim: the site publishes a TXT record carrying
its own token at the domain apex, and the Mail Domain is created only once that record
resolves. The token is fixed for the life of the site, so every domain it adds asks for the
same record and no other site can produce it.

The guard is aimed at tenants: it applies to requests made through the site API, which run as
the site service user. Operators adding a domain from the desk vouch for it themselves, and a
development cloud's operator may vouch for every tenant's domains at once with Suite Cloud
Settings' "Skip Domain Verification" - test domains exist in no public DNS.
